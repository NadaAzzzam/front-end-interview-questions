## **JS QUESTIONS**
## 1. what is javascript ?
- js is a high-level ("we don't have to worry about complex styff like memory management")
, object-oriented ("based on object, for storing most kinds of data")
, multi-paradigm ("we can use different styles of programming")
 programming language ("instruct computer to do things")

## 2. JS Releases?
- ES5, ES6/ES2015, ES7/ES2016, ES8/ES2017, ES9/ES2018, ES10/ES2019, ES11/ES2020
- ES:ECMAScript, From ES6 they called it modern javascript and there is a new updates to JS every single year.

## 3. whta is a variable?
- it is baseically a box into which we can store a value.

## 4. object and primitves?
- so value is only primitves when it's not an object.

## 5. the 7 primitves data types?
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolen

4. undefined:value taken of variable is not yet defind. ## let children
5. Null: aslo mean emoty value and type of null is an object.
6. symbol(ES5):value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not useful for now]
7. bigInt(ES2020):larger intergers than the number type can hold
 
**JS has dynamic typing: we don't have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. instead, data types are determind automatically**

## 6. what's defenation of "typeof" ?
- it is special operator to know type of variable.

## 7. what's operator?
- it allow us to transform values or combine multiple values, and there is many tpes of operator:
#### -mathematical or arithmetic operation
    let x= 100 +200

#### -assignment operator
    let x += 1
    let x -= 1
    let x--
    let x++
#### -comparison operator
    let x = 100
    let y = 500

    x>y // false

**math operator executed before comparison operators**

## 8. what's type conversion and type coerion?
- type conversion: when you manually convert from one type to anthor.

    let x=10
    String(x) + 1 // 101
    Number(x) + 1 // 11
- type coerion: when js automatically converts types behind the sciene.

    '12'-'10' //2
    '12'+'10' //1210

## 9. How to check truthy and falsy ?
    you can check it with Boolean().

## 10. what's  difference between experission vs statements?
- experission:  like a piece of code that produces a value. //3 + 4
- statements: like a bigger piece of code that's executed and which doesn't produce a value on itself. "like full sentences that translate our actions" //if(true){const x ='10'}

**Template literal expect experission not a statement**
